# Ptolemy üó∫Ô∏èüêçü¶Ä

This project exposes an API that calculates the shortest path in the road network, using data from OpenStreetMap.

## Why

This a personal adventure with Rust, threads, graphs, memmap and HTTP API. Of course, there are other projects that do more or less the
same thing, with different trade-offs and production-readiness, but this one, this one is mine!

## Overview

TODO: show some nices examples

## Project status

In development, feel free to join! Main features and future roadmap:

- [x] Parse OSM data
- [x] Generate and serialize graph
- [x] Ensure the network is strongly-connected
- [ ] Document graph generation process
- [ ] Load stored data
- [ ] Create shortest-path API
- [ ] Create parallel distance matrix API
- [x] Improve serialized data format

## Usage

1. The process starts by downloading the raw OpenStreetMap data. A good source is the pre-packaged data from [GeoFabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/).
    You will need the *.osm.pbf format
2. Execute the `generator` to extract the data from the raw format and create the final graph. For example, for Brazil:
    ```
    $ cargo run -p generator --release -- -i data/brazil-latest.osm.pbf -o data/brazil.ptolemy
    [   0.0s] Will use 16 threads
    [   0.3s] Loaded 17.5k blobs from 835.2MiB
    [   6.0s] Loaded 129.1M nodes (of which, 21.9k barriers) from 16.1k blobs
    [   9.0s] Loaded 3.7M ways
    [   9.0s] Detected 6.8M junctions
    [  14.5s] Create graph with 6.7M nodes and 16.8M edges
    [  15.0s] Pruned unreachable nodes
    [  15.0s] Graph now has 6.5M nodes (-190.9k) and 16.4M edges (-355.5k)
    [  16.1s] Weakly-connected components were strongly connected
    [  16.1s] Graph now has 16.5M edges (+70.9k)
    [  21.3s] All smaller components were strongly connected with the main one
    [  21.3s] Graph now has 16.5M edges (+172)
    [  49.8s] Wrote results to data/brazil.ptolemy, size = 93.2MiB
    [  49.8s] Done! #DFTBA
    ```
3. TODO

## Data format at rest

The cartography data is stored in a binary and compressed format in a single `.ptolemy` file

Its contents, once decompressed with ZLIB would yield a binary sequence formatted like:

```rs
{
    num_nodes: u32,
    num_edges: u32,
    node_latitudes: [i32; num_nodes],
    node_longitudes: [i32; num_nodes],
    edge_sources: [i32; num_edges],
    edge_targets: [i32; num_edges],
    edge_distances: [i32; num_edges],
    edge_road_levels: [i32; num_edges],
}
```

All the list fields are [delta-encoded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delta_encoding) and once decoded will be strictly non-negative. That is, the `i32` is used only to encode possibly decreasing values.

The nodes are sorted by `(latitude, longitude)` and the edges by `(source, target)`.

Both latitude and longitude are stored as `1 / 1 000 000` of a degree. The distance is stored in meters and the road level is a value from 0 (main roads) to 5 (smaller roads).

## Development

1. Install [Rust ü¶Ä](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). As of the time of this writing, you'll need the nightly version.
2. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
3. Prepare the Python environment with `conda env create` then `conda activate view-graph`
4. Compile and install the Python native module with `VIRTUAL_ENV="$CONDA_PREFIX" maturin develop -m pycartograph/Cargo.toml --release`
5. Start the notebook server with `jupyter notebook`

## Tests

The project is split into two parts: `cartograph` and `pycartograph`. The first is a pure Rust implementation and the second one implements the Python bindings.

Only the first part has automated tests and you can run then with `cargo test -p cartograph`
